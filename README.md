# Mr Librarian - Book Rental System

This is a full-stack book rental system developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The system allows users to issue and return books, view transactions, and manage books issued by users. The backend provides APIs for book and transaction management, while the frontend offers a user interface to interact with the system.
